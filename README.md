This vignette demonstrates how to use the functions in the `SpFut.processGBIF` package in sequence.

# Overview

The package contains three functions to easily download and clean GBIF data using the `rgbif` functions. 

- `downloadGBIF`
- `cleanGBIF`
- `processGBIF`

The first two function can be used in sequence or `processGBIF` can be used as a standalone (it is a wrapper for the first two).

See doc/processGBIF.html for a package demonstration.
